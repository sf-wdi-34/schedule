We'll check homework through the [daily pulse check form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScL2yoPs7IOJ1vQrpE4NMt3dlENu7pY5WyOk5d8IIEJ_XFkOw/viewform). We expect that you will submit your work every day through the pulse check form.

You can expect that we will give you feedback on one homework assignment per week. This [homework rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFEfxUsMYDhIHnZnwrjVeedaYcCR-cvGH9U5aCzVU2Y/edit?usp=sharing) shows you the factors we'll consider in giving you homework feedback.
