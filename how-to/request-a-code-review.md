# Code Reviews

Code reviews are a great way to get ideas, tips, and feedback on your projects:

- Learn best practices
- Discover new patterns/strategies for tackling problems
- Get a second pair of eyes on your code (fewer bugs!)

We encourage you to request at least 3 code reviews during your time as a student. They are an awesome way to "level up" and get individual feedback. Don't freak out, it's super valuable, and it's not that scary! We're happy to do them -- but it's up to you to ask!

## How to Request a Code Review

1. Push your project to GitHub.
2. Add your instructor/reviewer as a collaborator (*Settings > Collaborators & Teams > Add Collaborator*).  
    + bgveenstra - Brianna  
    + cofauver - Cory  

3. To request the review, simply send a message to your instructor using Slack with a link to your project.
    + Describe what you're doing, and indicate any areas of concern / code you want us to pay particular attention to.

#### What to expect

Depending on your instructor, your review may entail:

- **GitHub Issues**: these are commonly used to flag problems/issues with code, or areas of concern.
    + GitHub issues can be closed or resolved either on GitHub or by writing commit messages that reference the issue number (e.g. `git commit -m "fixes #10"`).
- **A `code_review` branch**: This may either be a single commit with many inline comments/todos, or multiple commits, each addressing/fixing a specific problem.
    + We do not advise you merge code_review branches into your master branch -- please take the time to learn/absorb the feedback and implement the changes yourself.
