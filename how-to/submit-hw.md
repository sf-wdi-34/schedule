#Instructions for Submitting Homework

Check your class schedule for a write up of the nightly homework and weekend labs.

Most of the work we'll ask you to do will live in its own repository, which you will need to **fork & clone**.  These repositories will usually live in your class's GitHub organization.

Each day, you'll be asked to submit a link to the previous night's homework on our [daily pulse check form](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScL2yoPs7IOJ1vQrpE4NMt3dlENu7pY5WyOk5d8IIEJ_XFkOw/viewform). The assignment will specify the link to submit each day.

## What's submitted?
**Do Submit**

* If we say "**DUE TONIGHT**" in the homework write up, we want you to submit it a link in the pulse check.
* You should always *fork & clone* homework.

**Do NOT Submit**

* Exercises from morning/afternoon modules. These are are for your own practice / review and are NOT submitted unless explicitly requested.

## Forking and Cloning

In order to submit homework, you must first *fork & clone* the homework/lab repo. If you do not *fork*, you will not have your own copy of the repository on GitHub. If you do not *clone* the repository to your computer, you won't have a working copy to change locally. Here are the steps:

1. Create a fork of the class version of a repository by clicking "Fork" on the top right. Make sure you're starting from the class version linked in the schedule.

2. Forking creates a copy of the original class repo on your own GitHub account. You'll see a screen like this while GitHub is forking the repo.

3. Now you have your own copy of the repo! GitHub even redirects you to your new copy on your account! Make sure you're on your GitHub account, and copy the "clone URL" from the top.

4. Use the "clone URL" to clone the repo onto your local machine.  Cloning takes a remote repository and makes a local copy.  Start by opening up your Terminal and navigating to your `~/wdi` directory. Then run the following commands, copying and pasting in the correct clone url instead of <clone-url>.  


  ```zsh
  ➜  cd ~/wdi
  ➜  git clone <clone-url>
  ```

5. You should now have a copy of the repo inside your `~/wdi` directory! Change directories into the repo you cloned.

  ```zsh
  ➜  cd <repo-name-goes-here>
  ```

1. As you complete the tasks from the homework instructions, remember to commit your local changes as you go, and check `git status`!

  ```zsh
  ➜  git status

  ➜  git add <filename>

  ➜  git status

  ➜  git commit -m "adds <filename>"
  ```
